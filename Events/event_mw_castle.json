A young girl sits beside a half-finished sand castle, she works tirelessly trying to beat the incoming tide.\r\n\r\nAs the sun begins to set, she takes notice of your crew with sharp, curious eyes. Turning her attention back to her work, she eventually puts on the final touches. For such a young child, it truly is a stunningly complex piece of art.\r\n\r\nThe girl looks up at the three of you and begins to ask a flurry of questions from Starships to mechwarriors and what it means to be prepared for threats that might come from beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\nThough friendly, she speaks with the seriousness of someone carrying more weight than her age should allow.",
