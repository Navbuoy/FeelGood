MedTechs dart around the Medbay tending to the various wounds she suffered. Within minutes, the doctor turns to you with a small smile signalling that she's in stable condition.\r\n\r\nWith a quizzical look on your face you turn to Darius, \"Is she who I think she is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a Jade Falcon pilot, Commander.\" \r\n\r\nDarius finally discloses his thoughts on the matter, \"Commander, I honestly don't know what to do? Word has already gotten out and the crew is spooked. Some have lost loved ones to the Clans, so there's no telling what this will do to morale.\"\r\n\r\n\"All valid points, but I hate to admint, this is too good an opportunity to pass up. We could gain some valuable intel on these Clans and how they operate giving us an edge in the field.\", you reply.\r\n\r\nDarius mulls it over, \"Maybe, we could hand her off to the Steiners?
