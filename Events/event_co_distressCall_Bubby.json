See for yourself...\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen and can barely make out the gibberish with the odd legible word here and there.\r\n\r\n<b>5 0 5\r\n\r\n1 907 2 9E7 A 11F7 FA57\r\n\r\n1 907 250000 CB1115 4 A55157\r\n\r\n1 907 A B16 BAD B07 4 A55157 2\r\n\r\n175 A 900D DEA1 4 A11\r\n\r\n5 0 5</b>\r\n\r\n\"The coordinates lead to an abandoned mine shaft exit at the other side of the ridgeline. I doubt any random pirate would set up such an elaborate trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm reading this right, the reward is 250 000 CBills and a mech for an extraction?\", you wonder.\r\n\r\nSumire shrugs, \"Actually, the ridgeline is high enough for me to make an approach without tripping up any sensors so it's not that bad a pickup spot, all things considered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's up to you Commander.\", Dr. Murad prompts",

He is a technician that mainly salvages in hostile environments. During one of his salvage runs, he spotted a mech pilot in distress and quickly ran over to provide assistance. After a quick field repair, the pilot was able to make it back home...to their pirate base. At that point, Uncle Bubby, was <i>recruited</i> to their languishing MechBays. They even went as far as to move him around to their satellite bases periodically. \r\n\r\nUncle Bubby continues, \"Can you believe this was my third escape attempt? Seems like most folks wouldn't give me the time of day! Thank the Maker, you guys showed up. Trust me, you got a friend for life in good ol' Uncle Bubby. As agreed, I'll give you one of my custom mechs as payment. It's a Falcon!\" \r\n\r\nYang snorts, \"A Faclon? O.K. I mean, are you sure - they're pretty rare but we'll gladly take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't you worry about that. You did me a solid and I have to sweeten the deal. This is not just any Falcon, mind you but something even more rare...it's a Royal Falcon replete with two medium lasers and a genuine Snub-nose PPC.\"\r\n\r\nYang is left speechless by the sales pitch.\r\n\r\nBreaking the silence, you reply, \"That's quite impressive! We appreciate the gift.\"\r\n\r\nWithout missing a beat, Uncle Bubby quips, \"Trust me, you made a buddy for life. If you are ever in the Periphery again, don't be a stranger. I'll hook you guys up with even better gear then!\"",
