See for yourself...\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen and can barely make out the gibberish with the odd legible word here and there.\r\n\r\n<b>5 0 5\r\n\r\n1 907 2 9E7 A 11F7 FA57\r\n\r\n1 907 250000 CB1115 4 A55157\r\n\r\n1 907 A B16 BAD B07 4 A55157 2\r\n\r\n175 A 900D DEA1 4 A11\r\n\r\n5 0 5</b>\r\n\r\n\"The coordinates lead to an abandoned mine shaft exit at the other side of the ridgeline. I doubt any random pirate would set up such an elaborate trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm reading this right, the reward is 250 000 CBills and a mech for an extraction?\", you wonder.\r\n\r\nSumire shrugs, \"Actually, the ridgeline is high enough for me to make an approach without tripping up any sensors so it's not that bad a pickup spot, all things considered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's up to you Commander.\", Dr. Murad prompts",
