    "Details" : "Point Commander Calista Folkner was found near death in her fallen Mad Dog. Her star did not survive the last encounter with your company and it was pure happenstance that your salvage crews happened upon her before any of her Jade Falcon clanmates arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was through your team's humanitarian efforts that Calista managed to survive much to her chagrin. Now as your bondsman, she is lending her unique insights and incomparable skills to your crew, both on and off the battlefield.",
